#### **What the client does:** 
*high-tech manufacturer of health focused products*  

#### **Target demographic:** 
*women*  

#### **Questions to guide analysis**  
<ol>
<li>_What are some trends in smart device usage?_</li>  
<li>_How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?_</li>  
<li>_How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?_</li>
</ol>

#### **Deliverables**
**You will produce a report with the following deliverables:**
<ol>
<li>*A clear summary of the business task*</li>
<li>*A description of all data sources used*</li>
<li>*Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data*</li>
<li>*A summary of your analysis*</li>
<li>*Supporting visualizations and key findings*</li>
<li>*Your top high-level content recommendations based on your analysis*</li>
</ol>

### **1. Ask**
_Analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices. Then, select one Bellabeat product to apply these insights to in your presentation._

##### **Deliverable** 
*A clear statement of the business task*

##### **Statment of business task**  
_To analyze and gain insights from non-bellabeat smart devices and apply insights to a bellabeat product._

```{r}
# set theme
theme_set(
  theme_classic() +
    theme(legend.position = "right")
)
```

### **2. Prepare**  

You've been advised to use public data that explores smart device users’daily habits:  
_FitBit Fitness Tracker Data (CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available through Mobius): This Kaggle data set contains personal fitness tracker from thirty fitbit users. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users’ habits._

#### **Dataset to be used:** 
**Website:** *Kaggle*  
**User:** *Möbius*  
**Dataset:** *Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data link [**here**](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit)*

You've been advised that this data set might have some limitations, and encourages you to consider adding another data to help address those limitations as you begin to work more with this data.  

Obvious FitBase dataset limitations:  
1. Only data for 30 users
2. No indicators as to why some users did not utilize certain features, i.e. weight logs, heart rate

**Possible other datasets:**

1. **An Open Dataset for Human Activity Analysis - Data collected using Smartphone, Smartwatch and Smartglasses**
https://www.kaggle.com/sasanj/human-activity-smart-devices

2. **Smartphone and Smartwatch Activity and Biometrics - Motion-based biometrics using activities of daily living**
https://www.kaggle.com/mashlyn/smartphone-and-smartwatch-activity-and-biometrics

##### **Deliverable** 
*A clear statement of the business task*
A description of all data sources used


### **3. Process**

#### Cleaning and Transforming Data

18 data files total; chose 5 data sets that of daily records, and split time stamps into their own columns.

###### Heart Rate Data  
Started with largest dataset, heartrate_seconds_merged.csv, in R script fitbit_hr_seconds_cleaning; converted 'by second' data into a daily min, max, average, and SD readings per Session ID (id). Pulled resulting csv into Google sheets and converted date column into yyyy-mm-dd format.
data already in long format;  

Resulting file for GitHub Dataset titled _fitbit_hr_min_max_per_id_date_2.csv_ will be used to gain insights during the analysis phase.

###### Daily Steps Data  
dailySteps_merged.csv, cleaned in Google sheets, data already in long format  

Resulting file for GitHub Dataset titled _dailySteps_mergedclean.csv_ will be used to gain insights during the analysis phase.

###### Daily Calories Data  
dailyCalories_merged.csv, cleaned in Google sheets, data already in long format  

Resulting file for GitHub Dataset titled _dailyCalories_mergedclean.csv_ will be used to gain insights during the analysis phase.

###### Daily Sleep Minutes Data  
sleepDay_merged.csv, cleaned in Google sheets, data already in long format  

Resulting file for GitHub Dataset titled _sleepDay_mergedclean.csv_ will be used to gain insights during the analysis phase.

###### Weight Log Data  
Smallest dataset cleaned in Google Sheets: weightLogInfo_merged.csv. 

Resulting file for GitHub Dataset titled _weightLogInfo_mergedclean.csv_ will be used to gain insights during the analysis phase.
